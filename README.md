Replicating Super Mario Bros. in Unity
(CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS)

##### Specs
* Engine: Unity 2018.1.2f1
* Text editor: Visual Studio 2017

##### Wanna look into this project?
1. Clone or download the project to your computer.
2. Open in Unity.
3. Open scene: Assets/_Project/Scenes/Test_Mario.unity

##### Controls:
* W, A, S, D - Movement
* Space - Jump
* E, R - CHEAT: Power-up, Power-down
* T, Y - CHEAT: Kill, Revive

##### Notes:
* This is a work in progress, the aim here is to replicate the 1-1 level of the game.
* Another aim is to make a full game with only using out-of-the-box Unity tools, and not depend on a plugin available on the Unity Asset Store.
* If you wanna look at the scripts please go to Assets/_Project/Sources/Scripts.
